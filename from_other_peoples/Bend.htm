Copy the Object Bender include file (<I>Bend.inc</I>) to one of the directories
(folders) in your POV-Ray library path.  Normally this is the <I>INCLUDE</I>
sub-directory of the directory where you installed POV-Ray, so if you
installed POV-Ray in <I>C:\POVRAY</I> you should copy the <I>Bend.inc</I> file to
<I>C:\POVRAY\INCLUDE</I>.  On a Windows 95 system, this is probably something 
like:

<P><I>C:\Program Files\POV-Ray for Windows\Include</I>

<P>On UNIX and similar systems, where filenames are case-sensitive, you may
have to rename the include file so that it starts with a capital and the
remaining letters are lowercase.  This will enable you to render the
sample files without modification.

The Object Bender include file lets you bend and/or twist any POV-Ray object, from a
simple box to a complex CSG object.  You can specify the direction to
bend the object in, and bend the object by any angle up to 360 degrees.
There are other options which control how the object will be bent;
to use any of these you simply add the following line to your POV-Ray
scene file:

<P><CODE>#declare </CODE><I>[variable-name]</I><CODE> = </CODE><I>[value]</I>

<P>substituting the desired variable name and value where appropriate.  After
you have declared all the options you want to use, you add the following
line to your POV-Ray scene file:

<P><CODE>#include "Bend.inc"</CODE>

<P>The Object Bender include file will then automatically create the bent
object for you.  Although only one option is required to bend an object
(<A HREF="bend_object">bend_object</A>) you will want to use the options listed below to ensure
you get the result that you want.

<P><I>Note that Bend.inc should <B>never</B> be included at the start of a scene
(like </I>colors.inc<I> or </I>textures.inc<I>).  It should only be included after
first declaring the desired bend options.</I>

<A NAME="Options"></A><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>OPTIONS</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><HR><A NAME="Object Options"></A>
<B><I>OBJECT OPTIONS</B></I>
<HR>
The first step when using the Object Bender include file is to specify
a number of parameters that identify the object you wish to bend, as
well as its position in the POV-Ray universe.

<P><A NAME="bend_object"></A>
<B>bend_object</B>
<HR>
This parameter indicates the object you want to bend or twist, and can be either
a predefined object or a completely new object definition, including
textures and transformations, eg:

<CODE><P>#declare bend_object = object {MyObject scale 3}
<BR>#declare bend_object = cylinder {-y, y, .3 pigment {Red}}</CODE>

<P>Any POV-Ray object can be used, including CSG objects and triangle meshes.

<P><A NAME="object axes"></A>
<B>object_axis1 & object_axis2</B>
<HR>
The two axis parameters are vectors which indicate the axis of the
<A HREF="bend_object">bend_object</A>.  The object axis is like a piece of wire that runs through the
object, starting at <I>object_axis1</I> and ending at <I>object_axis2</I>.  When the
wire is bent, the object stretches and squashes to follow the shape of
the wire.  When bending the object, <I>object_axis1</I> remains fixed, while
<I>object_axis2</I> is moved as the axis is bent.  If you specify a <A HREF="#twist_angle">twist_angle</A> the object is twisted around the object axis.

<P>The default for <I>object_axis1</I> is -y; the default for <I>object_axis2</I> is +y
<BR>

<P><HR><A NAME="Bend Options"></A>
<B><I>BENDING OPTIONS</I></B>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="bend_angle"></A>
<B>bend_angle</B>
<HR>
This is the angle (measured in degrees) that the object will be bent by.
It can range from 0 (no bending) to 360 (the object is bent in a full
circle).  Using <CODE>bend_angle = 180</CODE> will bend the object in a half circle,
and other angles will bend the object by different amounts.  You can also
use negative angles to bend the object backwards.

<P>The default for <I>bend_angle</I> is 45 degrees

<P><A NAME="bend_direction"></A>
<B>bend_direction</B>
<HR>
This vector specifies the direction in which to bend the object; if the
bend_object lies along the x-axis, using <CODE>bend_direction = y</CODE> will bend the
object upwards.

<P>The default for <I>bend_direction</I> is x

<P><A NAME="twist_angle"></A>
<B>twist_angle</B>
<HR>
This option allows you to twist the <A HREF="#bend_object">bend_object</A> around the
axis specified by <I>object_axis1</I> and <I>object_axis2</I>, by any number of degrees.
Positive angles will twist the object clockwise, while negative angles will twist the
object anti-clockwise.  The remaining options (<I>bend_smoothness</I>, <I>bend_start</I>,
and <I>bend_finish</I>) control the twisting of the object in the same way as
the bending.

<P>The default for <I>twist_angle</I> is 0

<P><A NAME="bend_smoothness"></A>
<B>bend_smoothness</B>
<HR>
This option controls how smooth the bent/twisted object will be; using smaller
numbers will give an angular bend, while using larger numbers will make
the bend and twist much smoother.  The value of <I>bend_smoothness</I> specifies how many
segments the <A HREF="bend_object">bend_object</A> will be divided into, <I>per full revolution</I>, eg:
if you use <CODE>bend_smoothness = 50</CODE> and <CODE>bend_angle = 180</CODE>, the Object Bender
include file will use 25 segments when bending the object.

<P>This option can have a large effect on the speed of parsing and
rendering; if you are doing quick preview you should set <I>bend_smoothness</I>
to 0 (which will use the minimum number of segments).  If the bent
object is not as smooth as you want, you should increase this option.

<P>The default for <I>bend_smoothness</I> is 100

<P><A NAME="bend_start"></A>
<B>bend_start</B>
<HR>
You can use this option to only bend and/or twist a partial section of the <A HREF="bend_object">bend_object</A>,
rather than deforming the whole object.  The value of this option should lie
between 0 and 1, eg. using <CODE>bend_start = .5</CODE> will only start bending the
object halfway along its length.

<P>The default for <I>bend_start</I> is 0

<P><A NAME="bend_finish"></A>
<B>bend_finish</B>
<HR>
This option also allows you to partially bend an object, and its value
should lie between 0 and 1, eg. using <CODE>bend_finish = .7</CODE> will stop bending
the object 70% along its length (the rest of the object will continue
straight from this point).

<P>The default for <I>bend_finish</I> is 1

<P>Note that you can use the <I>bend_start</I> and <I>bend_finish</I> options together to
only bend or twist the middle section of an object, eg. <CODE>bend_start = .3</CODE> and
<CODE>bend_finish = .6</CODE> will only deform the middle 30% of the object.
